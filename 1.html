  <h2>HTML</h2>
  Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 sepcification"><strong>World Wide <u>Web</u> pages.</strong></a>
  <p>This CSS module defines CSS support for various international writing modes and their combinations, including left-to-right and right-to-left text ordering as well as horizontal and vertical orientations. These new CSS features allow a mixture of horizontal and vertical text regions on the same page. The specification also adds support for such things as isolation in bidirectional text, glyph orientation controls, and short, inline horizontal runs in lines of vertical text.

  <p style="margin-top:45px;">W3C standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device. Although the boundaries of the platform continue to evolve, industry leaders speak nearly in unison about how HTML5 will be the cornerstone for this platform. But the full strength of the platform relies on many more technologies that W3C and its partners are creating, including CSS, SVG, WOFF, the Semantic Web stack, XML, and a variety of APIs.
